@article{Oeren1979,
	Abstract = {Conventional simulation techniques have three short comings when applied to large-scale modelling : They provide an inadequate man-machine interface, they provide a poor conceptual framework, and they lack needed tools for managing data and model. These shortcomings may be ameliorated by developing new simulation languages that differentiate the function aZ elements of simulation programs and by recognizing the goals of these functional elements. This paper provides concepts for the design and implementation of such advanced simulation methodologies.},

	Abstract = {Conducting large-scale complex modeling and simulation (M&S) projects continues to 
pose significant challenges for M&S engineers, project managers, and sponsoring 
organizations. This paper presents a M&S life cycle to alleviate the challenges. The M&S life 
cycle describes a framework for organization of the processes, work products, quality 
assurance activities, and project management activities required to develop, use, maintain, 
and reuse a M&S application from birth to retirement. It provides guidance to a M&S 
developer (engineer), manager, organization, and community of interest. The M&S life cycle 
specifies the work products to be created by executing the corresponding processes, 
together with the integrated verification, validation, and quality assurance activities. The 
M&S life cycle is critically needed to modularize and structure a M&S application 
development, and to provide valuable guidance for conducting a M&S project 
successfully.},

A tradeoff analysis can be made to help the modeler decide on a data collection method and budget, the number of observations to collect, and suitable model builder's and user's risk levels for testing the validity under a given set of experimental conditions. A model of an M/M/1 queuing system with two performance measures serves as an example for the validation procedure. },

However, neither defining a metamodel nor developing a model transformation is an easy task. In this paper, we provide an overview of metamodeling and model transformations in MDD and discuss about the use of a MDD approach in Modeling and Simulation (M&S). In order to support the development of successful model transformations, we define the criteria for the evaluation of model transformations.},

	Abstract = {Even though we have moved beyond the Industrial Age and into the Information Age, manufacturing remains an important part of the global economy. There is a need for the pervasive use of modeling and simulation for decision support in current and future manufacturing systems, and several challenges need to be addressed by the simulation community to realize this vision. First, an order of magnitude reduction in problem-solving cycles is needed. The second grand challenge is the development of real-time, simulation-based problem-solving capability. The third grand challenge is the need for true plug-and-play interoperability of simulations and supporting software. Finally, there is the biggest challenge facing modeling and simulation analysts today: that of convincing management to sponsor modeling and simulation projects instead of, or in addition to, more commonly used manufacturing system design and improvement methods such as lean manufacturing and six sigma.},

@incollection{Fumarola2011,
	Abstract = {Much of the performance of a logistic system is determined by the quality of its design. A rich body of knowledge has been developed during the last decades that supports the product as well as the process of designing. Design methods for systems have initially defined the product by providing a framework to construct models to analyze the constructed artifact. This approach, which would later be coined the hard systems approach, would turn out to contain flaws in assumptions concerning of the existence of an (quasi-) optimal solution and by neglecting humans involved in the process. However, the techniques developed to support the approach, most notably simulation, have matured and are now commonly used to analyze designs. A major shift in approach took place to redeem for the perceived failures in systems design processes. This resulted in a tendency to focus on the diverging views of actors involved in the process, which was termed as the soft systems approaches. To profit from both sides, multimethodological approaches have been presented, assuming that a combination is feasible to take the best of both worlds. Participative simulation sessions have the potential to support the design processes: (1) in a multi-actor environment with diverging stakes, and (2) without ignoring the fact that human decision making relies on implicit knowledge that is insufficient and unreliable to evaluate decisions, thus requiring simulation for support. In this chapter, we present the rationale for requiring a multimethodological approach and discuss which aspects should be covered based on existing research literature.},

	Abstract = {Modeling and simulation in design processes is traditionally used during the analysis of the future system. However, simulation-based design allows the use of modeling and simulation throughout the synthesis phase which offers greater flexibility to quickly compare alternative designs. In case of container terminals, these alternatives are based on different aspects such as layouts, terminal operating systems, and equipments. Container terminals are characterized by a large number of entity types with multiple instances, interacting in various non-trivial ways. A component-based approach makes the construction of a suitable model easier: the designer can focus on the relevant constructs instead of lower level details. However, much effort is needed to achieve compatibility and modularity between the components. DEVS provides the higher level constructs to conceptualize a complex system independently from the underlying implementation. We present a DEVS component library for container terminal design wherein much attention has been put into the conceptual distinction between control and mechanics. This results in a library that can actively support the design process of containers terminals.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes the aims, methodology and results of an empirical research project. The aim was to gather new insight about how collaborative decision-making processes in the conceptual engineering design phase of the product development process takes place. The insight contributes to bridging the gap between the theoretical development of new decision-making methods in academia and the needs of practitioners. The researchers observed, recorded and transcribed three workshops involving groups that were engaged in the collaborative decision-making processes. Through analysing the transcripts, a set of decision-making related activities was identified. Each activity's time consumption was quantified, and a number of decision-making process models at different levels of detail were developed. During this analysis, various observations on particular process characteristics were made. It was observed that generating formal structures and documentation was beneficial to the decision-making process. This was particularly true with respect to developing problem understanding and consistency. The outcomes should be valuable for the design and development of improved decision-support systems.},

	Abstract = {Two paradigms characterize much of the research in the Information Systems discipline: behavioral science and design science. The behavioral-science paradigm seeks to develop and verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational behavior. The design-science paradigm seeks to extend the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts. Both paradigms are foundational to the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the confluence of people, organizations, and technology. Our objective is to describe the performance of design-science research in Information Systems via a concise conceptual framework and clear guidelines for understanding, executing, and evaluating the research. In the design-science paradigm, knowledge and understanding of a problem domain and its solution are achieved in the building and application of the designed artifact. Three recent exemplars in the research literature are used to demonstrate the application of these guidelines. We conclude with an analysis of the challenges of performing high-quality design-science research in the context of the broader IS community.},

The various statistical problems associated with output data analyses such as start-up bias and determination of estimator accuracy are described in detail. We then discuss the best available techniques for addressing these problems, as well as topics for future research. The paper concludes with a discussion of how developments in simulation languages, computer graphics, and computer execution speed may affect the future of output analyses.},

	Abstract = {Eight sixth-grade students received individualized instruction on addition and subtraction of fractions in a one-to-one setting for six weeks. Instruction was designed to build on the student's informal knowledge of fractions. All students possessed a rich store of informal knowledge of fractions that was based on partitioning units and treating the parts as whole numbers. Students' informal knowledge was initially disconnected from their knowledge of fraction symbols and procedures. Students related fraction symbols and procedures to their informal knowledge in ways that were meaningful to them; however, knowledge of rote procedures frequently interfered with students' attempts to build on their informal knowledge.},

	Abstract = {This article aims to present examples of computer simulation models that support decision-making processes in the health care sector. The objective of this review is to propose a system of classification of health care topic areas examined with the assistance of simulation methods. The categories described in literature were expanded and a detailed taxonomy for sub-groups was formulated. Usefulness of simulation modeling techniques was investigated and an attempt was made to correlate the simulation approach with a corresponding health care application group from the suggested classification.},

@article{Mosterman2004,
	Abstract = {Modeling and simulation are quickly becoming the primary enablers for complex system design. They allow the representation of intricate knowledge at various levels of abstraction and allow automated analysis as well as synthesis. The heterogeneity of the design process, as much as of the system itself, however, requires a manifold of formalisms tailored to the specific task at hand. Efficient design approaches aim to combine different models of a system under study and maximally use the knowledge captured in them. Computer Automated Multi-Paradigm Modeling (CAMPaM) is the emerging field that addresses the issues involved and formulates a domain-independent framework along three dimensions: (1) multiple levels of abstraction, (2) multiformalism modeling, and (3) meta-modeling. This article presents an overview of the CAMPaM field and shows how transformations assume a central place. These transformation are, in turn, explicitly modeled themselves by graph grammars.},

Some such simulators are promoted as general purpose, while others are specific to particular problem domains. This paper considers how domain-specific data-driven simulators should be constructed using a modular approach which allows the simulator to be incrementally enhanced and ported easily to alternative computing environments.

@article{Rozenblit1991,
	Abstract = { This paper proposes a new approach to simula tion modeling of natural systems in the context of water quality modeling in streams affected by point source pollution. The approach has a potential for application to other domains of natural resource modeling. Its conceptual basis is knowledge-based simulation and systems analysis. In the approach presented in this paper, a stream or its section is viewed as a collection of components, i.e. stream segments. The structure of a stream is its segments and their couplings. For each stream segment, a single constituent model describing processes affecting the segment's water quality is defined. Models are coupled in a hierarchical manner. The hierarchi cal, modular model specification results in a stream model comprised of a finite number of sub-segment models. Fundamental theoretical concepts supporting such a specification are described. A prototype simulation modeling environment to support prediction of water quality in streams has been implemented and tested. The proposed approach differs from other natural systems modeling frameworks in that it offers a) modular model specification facilities, b) high degree of model reusability, and c) support for model selection and coupling. },

@article{Sheather1991,
	Abstract = {We present a new method for data-based selection of the bandwidth in kernel density estimation which has excellent properties. It improves on a recent procedure of Park and Marron (which itself is a good method) in various ways. First, the new method has superior theoretical performance; second, it also has a computational advantage; third, the new method has reliably good performance for smooth densities in simulations, performance that is second to none in the existing literature. These methods are based on choosing the bandwidth to (approximately) minimize good quality estimates of the mean integrated squared error. The key to the success of the current procedure is the reintroduction of a non-stochastic term which was previously omitted together with use of the bandwidth to reduce bias in estimation without inflating variance.},

	Abstract = {The future of air transportation modeling and simulation represents a grand challenge for both the air transportation and the modeling and simulation communities. In addition to its size and scope, air transportation has many technical, operational, organizational, policy, security and legal aspects contributing to its complexity, yet must ensure an un-rivaled level of safety throughout any transition to next generation systems. Thus, modeling and simulation must address not only technical challenges in representing a system of this complexity, but also institutional realities that prevent full data and model sharing between the many entities involved in air transportation. We outline the attributes of a shared repository of data, models and computational tools required to meet this challenge, including the coordination and administrative processes required to manage it, and provide an example of its potential application.},
